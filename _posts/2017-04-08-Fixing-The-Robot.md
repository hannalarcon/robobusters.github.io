Today, we decided to address one of the problems we were having at compeititon, the drving. With LabView, we were driving with the robot's front as front on the joystick. We re-coded in Java and used the gyroscope to program the controls relative to the field and not the robot. Currently with the Java version of the code, the robot smoothly manuevers and will be much easier to control during competition. Successful post-cometition adjustment!
