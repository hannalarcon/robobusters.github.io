<p>6/1/17</p>

<p>Robobusters was a team started 4 years ago by the School of Science and Engineering. Now, it has come to the time where
we say goodbye to the oldest veterans of the team. The class of 2017 has graduated and it has come the time when we honor
their legacy by concluding the 2016-2017 seasons and begin the 2017-2018 season.</p>

<p> This past season has been a great learning experience for the team. We developed many relationships within ourselves and 
  other teams. We learned together and endured together. Although the 2017 Dallas Regional was a dissappointment for us, it made
  us realize that we can do so much as a team and we have the potential to grow so much. That is why, we hope to change many things
  for this following season. We hope to contribute more to the community by inspiring young students to do robotics. We hope to get
  more organized so that we can have a smooth season. We hope to be posting more to our website so others can see our growth. We will
  come back strong for the 2017-2018 season. But for now, it is time to say goodbye to the old and bring in the new minds of 
  engineering. </p>
