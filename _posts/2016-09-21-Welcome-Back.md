Today was our second official meeting in school. Our team captian, Lauren Lugo, discussed what we needed to do to be ready
for this year's competition. We introduced our new members to the team and showed them how amazing the FIRST Robotics Challenge
is! We split into three teams to emulate the 2011 FRC challenge.

The red alliance came together and analyzed what the best approach of scoring points would be. We watched the challenge video
a couple of times to identify what the best approach would be to take. We showed the new members to the team what the different
resources were avalible to us and how they could be used to build the robot. We attempted to finalize a goal for our robot
so we could start planning designs and code next week. The blue alliance followed a similar path and ended at a goal for the
next meeting. Both teams created a similar design of focusing on a microbot to scale the tower due to points/second efficiency
as well as shooting for the top row of the logo.

Over on the buisness team, the division lead, Andre, showed everyone what they would be doing on the buisness team. He showed
that FRC teams apply for grants to major companies(such as NASA and the Texas Workforce Commision) so that our team can get
both funding and mentors to assist us on our journey. 

Over all, we made great progress during this meeting. We hope to continue working hard so that we are prepared for this year's
competition. Never forget: Gracious Professionalism!
