<p>It is finally time for another season of FRC. This year, it is FIRST Powerup. To reveal this year's challenge, we will have a kickoff
from the North Texas Region. At the Kick off we will see the entire game field, be given the game rules, basic training, and have a game break down with some other mentors. 
We recommend all students who can attend do attend. All we know now is that the game is called FIRST Power UP. </p>

<p>The 2018 FRC Season starts Saturday 01/06/2018, at the TI South Campus (Texas Instruments 12500 TI Blvd Dallas, TX 75243).
