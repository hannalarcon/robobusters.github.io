<p>6/1/17</p>

<p>Robobusters was a team started 4 years ago by the School of Science and Engineering. Now, it has come to the time where
we say goodbye to the oldest veterans of the team. The class of 2017 has graduated and it has come the time when we honor
their legacy by concluding the 2016-2017 seasons and begin the 2017-2018 season.</p>

<p> This past season has been a great learning experience for the team.....
